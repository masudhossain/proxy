== Welcome to HTTP Proxy

This is a Rails 3.1.1 HTTP Proxy application.  It allows users to surf the web through a single URL thus either masking their browsing experience or rendering pages in other frames on a page.  Page frames are not able to share content state.  This approach circumvents the browser's security design.

You can browse pages with the following URL structure:
http://localhost:3000/proxy?lnk=http://amazon.com
